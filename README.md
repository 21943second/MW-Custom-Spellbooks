## MW Custom Spellbook Colors

This packs adds differernt colors based on the "type" of spell that a book corresponds to. These can be broken into 4 different categories:

- Attack (orange)
- Buff (dark green)
- Souls (light green)
- Spells (purple)

### Important Note:

This pack utilized cit, therefore it required optifine (untested) or [CIT Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn). Specifically, it has been tested on Fabric version 1.20.4 and likely supports other versions but those have not been verified.
